It is approximately equal to 3.141593 in the usual decimal notation (see the table for its representation in some other bases). The constant is also known as Archimedes Constant, although this name is rather uncommon in modern, western, English-speaking contexts. Many formulae from mathematics, science, and engineering involve \u03C0, which is one of the most important mathematical and physical constants. \u03C0 is an irrational number, which means that its value cannot be expressed exactly as a fraction m/n, where m and n are integers. Consequently, its decimal representation never ends or repeats. It is also a transcendental number, which implies, among other things, that no finite sequence of algebraic operations on integers (powers, roots, sums, etc. ) can be equal to its value; proving this was a late achievement in mathematical history and a significant result of 19th century German mathematics. Throughout the history of mathematics, there has been much effort to determine \u03C0 more accurately and to understand its nature; fascination with the number has even carried over into non-mathematical culture. The Greek letter \u03C0, often spelled out pi in text, was adopted for the number from the Greek word for perimeter \"\u03C0\u03B5\u03C1\u03AF\u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03C1\u03BF\u03C2\", first by William Jones in 1707, and popularized by Leonhard Euler in 1737.",/what.+(is|does).*((an?|the) ([\w ]+?)
